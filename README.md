# Integrating Network Intrusion Detection Systems and Neural Network with Tensoflow

In this project, I will attempt to link a Network Intrsuions Detecion System and a Neural Network using Tensorflow to classify network activity

The aim of this project, is to link these two systems together, to develop an autonomous system where network traffic is captured using a Security Information and Event Manager system and this network traffic is then passed through a Neural Network which will output if the traffic captured is malicious or benign.

The idea behind this project is develop a system that will lower the costs of network security for organizations and provide a high level of sophistication and accuracy when dealing with network security.

I believe machine learning will have a major impact on security and how security is implemented in a company. The reason I decided on this project was a personal one, I worked in IT for a company which had a lot of clients, in this company there was a SOC department which monitored many external networks. This was a 24/7 operation and as a virtualization systems engineer, we would get calls at all hours from this team. Then I started to wonder why are they there at this time, is technology not advanced enough to have autonomous systems, could they not check a report or a confusion matrix in the morning instead of working 24/7. How accurate would a neural network algorithm be monitoring alerts? Is it trust worthy? Would the company benefit financially from this?
